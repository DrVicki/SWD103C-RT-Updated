## Set Up a Development Environment 

The first step in setting up your development environment is choosing your code editor. 

- Almost alk editors have essential features like autocompletion, syntax highlighting, formatting code, and smart refactoring. 
- Using them helps you prevent potential mistakes. 

We will use the Developer Tools of web browsers while debugging JavaScript code. 

- When finished setting up the development environment, your coding will be amazingly easy and fast. 

There are several tools you might consider so you could always choose any of them. No matter what tools you choose, you’ll follow a similar process to learn the lessons.

## 1.1 Install NodeJS 

Go to this website https://nodejs.org/en/download and download the latest LTS version of NodeJS; then install it onto your computer.

## 1.2 Install a Code Editor 

In these lessons, we’ll use Visual Studio Code (shortened to VS Code) as the code editor. 

- You can download this free at https://code.visualstudio.com/download 

### 1.2.1 Install Essential Extensions 

VS Code supports adding extensions which help us code faster and easier. 

After installing the editor, let’s add these essential extensions: 

- Prettier - Code formatter: Enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. 

- Path Intellisense: Visual Studio Code plugin that autocompletes filenames and paths.     

- Auto Rename Tag: Auto rename paired HTML/XML tags. 

- Reactjs code snippets: Code snippets for ReactJS development. 

- ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets: Extensions for React, React-Native and Redux in JS/TS with ES7+ syntax. 

- ESLint: Finds and fixes problems in your JavaScript code.     

- Rainbow Brackets: Provides rainbow colors for the round brackets, the square brackets and the squiggly brackets.     

- vscode-icons: File and folder icons for Visual Studio Code.
